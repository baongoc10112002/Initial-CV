    I am a Junior student at the University of Toledo.
    I am impressed by how technology can help human being in daily life and
    how much faster it can be developed in the future. Therefore, i choosed
    <strong>Computer Science</strong> as my major to help me becoming a
    <strong>Software Engineer</strong> in the field industry.
    Besides studying, I love spending time with friends and participating in
    organizations to improve my soft skills as well as to create unforgettable
    memories about my college life.
    I also worked part-time as a <em>Technical Assistant</em>, and <em>Math Tutor</em>
    at the University of Toledo to not only help UT students study better, but also
    to support them with their software problems in order to study online well
    during the COVID-19 pandemic
